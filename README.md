# ReadMe

- A dark theme made for Visual Studio Code which has text colors the same as as that of the atom text editor.
- This theme follows a white and black color scheme it also has color pairs for brackets which could be enabled by setting ```editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled``` in the settings.json file of your VSCode IDE.
> ```json
> "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
> ```

- To install this extension head to teh [release](https://github.com/Delta-Kiro/Dark-Mode-VSCode-theme/releases/latest) page and download the .vsix file the head to VSCode then install it using the command palette on macOS ```cmd + shift + p ``` or on Linux/Windows ```ctrl + shift + p``` and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** then head to the folder where you have downloaded the extension and select the extension and it will install it.

- I'm planning to add more colors in the future if you want any kind of color them and want to help me then please feel free to open a PR and i shall merge it if necessary and make a release 

- > NOTE: I'm planning to change the text colors in this theme sooner or later!
